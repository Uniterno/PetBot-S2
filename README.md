# PetBot-S2
PetBot S2 is a start-from-scratch PetBot project. Removing most of the old unmaintainable code and keeping it simple.

PetBot S2 includes the following improvements and changes:
- Supports multi-server. PetBot was originally designed for a single server and personal community, making a lot of things be slightly hardcoded. PetBot S2 changes this idea, and allows for any server to include PetBot and work.
- Account registering. For the same reason, PetBot users were usually managed manually, but that becomes an issue when attempting to make it grow. All account stuff is handled automatically now (as it should have been since the very beginning).
- Bye to bloating. PetBot was just a lot of ideas together for personal amusement, but that became a chaos at some point and it was too hard to keep up with everything. PetBot S2 aims to "Simple is best".
- Starting from scratch, but with a lot more knowledge, basically improving every aspect of the bot.

**However! Do note PetBot S2 is still a personal project for a personal community, not intended for a big and extended infrastructure and/or community.**
